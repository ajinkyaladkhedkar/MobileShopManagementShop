This is a very simple project to understand and implement a web application. I have created a step by step implementation of this application. The part 1 is a Java CMD program which is not user friendly but provides the logic to implement the application. The part 2 provides the front end which is created by using Java Applet. The part 3 includes code for a full stack application including connectivity in JDBC. This will provide a software engineer beginner to start building his Web application.
